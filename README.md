# call-the-roll-web
A simple web to call the roll, is practically coded all in javascript, made as learning exercise. Functioning is simple, just have 3 buttons to call the roll between 3 differents days, you can aswer with "si", to say the student is in class, "no", to say he's not, and if you type something else it would return an error.
